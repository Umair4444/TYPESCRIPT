for...in, for...of, and forEach are all used in JavaScript for looping over data structures like arrays and objects, but they have different use cases and behaviors.

for...in:

Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.
The loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including inherited ones from its prototype chain.
Typically used for iterating over the keys of an object.

Example:

const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};

for (let key in obj) {
    console.log(key, obj[key]);
}

for...of:

Iterates over the values of an iterable (such as an array or string), excluding objects.
It can't be used with plain objects; it works only with iterable objects.
It provides a more concise syntax compared to for...in.
Example:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];

for (let value of arr) {
    console.log(value);
}

forEach:

A method that belongs to arrays in JavaScript.
Iterates over the elements of an array.
Executes a provided function once for each array element.
Provides a more functional programming style.
Example:

const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.forEach(function(value) {
    console.log(value);
});

In summary:

Use for...in when you want to iterate over the properties of an object.
Use for...of when you want to iterate over the values of an iterable like an array.
Use forEach when you want to iterate over the elements of an array and perform some action on each element.
